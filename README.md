Hello! Welcome to my repository of demo codes along with their analysis. My name is Michael Morello. I am a Graduate Student at CUNY Queens College studying Data Analytics and Applied Social Research with an expected graduation date of June 2025. If your a recruiter and viewing this repository, I want to say thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to look at my work; I truly appreciate it. 
If you would like to see what these codes look like when they are ran in R, you can see that on my RPubs account @ https://rpubs.com/MichaelMorello24

I hope you enjoy my work and analysis, and once again, thank you for taking the time out of your day to review my work.

Sincerly,
Michael Morello
